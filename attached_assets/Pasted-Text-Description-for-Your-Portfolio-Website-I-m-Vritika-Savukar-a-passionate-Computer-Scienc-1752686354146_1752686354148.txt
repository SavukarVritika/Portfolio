Text Description for Your Portfolio Website
👩‍💻 I’m Vritika Savukar, a passionate Computer Science student currently in my penultimate year at Siddaganga Institute of Technology, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Design, and core CS subjects like Operating Systems, DBMS, and Computer Networks.

I’m especially interested in building scalable AI-driven applications that merge the power of ML, NLP, and Cloud Computing to solve real-world problems. My work often spans from intuitive frontend design to robust backend logic and intelligent model deployment.

My technical toolkit includes Python, Java, C, and frameworks like Flask, Streamlit, and LangChain. I’m highly comfortable with Unix/Linux, and I deploy projects using Google Cloud Platform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

🚀 Here are a few of my favorite projects:

🔮 AI Debate Arena – A debate platform powered by LangChain & LLMs, integrating models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Mistral for multi-round AI argument simulation and judging.

🧠 Cloud-Based Image Recognition System – An image classifier deployed using GCP AutoML, Flask backend, and Firebase frontend for real-time predictions.

🍲 Recipe Finder using NLP – Retrieves recipes from fuzzy ingredient input using string-matching and synonym expansion.

🎯 I'm also an active participant in hackathons and tech events, having been a Top 10 finalist in Smart India Hackathon 2024 and a Pre-Finalist in IndustrAI Hackathon @ IIT Madras 2025.

Outside tech, I’m a trained Carnatic classical vocalist, a self-defense enthusiast (Karate), and I enjoy mentoring juniors in DSA and open-source coding.

Bonus:

Use Framer Motion for animations on project cards, hero text, and section entrances.

Add responsive design, clean mobile layout, and meta tags for SEO.
Optional: Add a Blog section or Certifications timeline.
